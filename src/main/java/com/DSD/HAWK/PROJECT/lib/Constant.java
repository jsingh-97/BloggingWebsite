        new BlogResponse(UUID.randomUUID().toString(),"jawindervirk.jv.js@gmail.com","Omicron edition: Uncertainty, uncertainty, uncertainty ","What do we know about the Omicron variant of concern? The following is a 28 November article by Zeynep Tufekci that appeared in her blog Insight. She is an associate professor at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with an affiliate appointment at the Department of Sociology. The original article can be found here. We have a new variant in town, Omicron. I was hoping to avoid learning the Greek alphabet, but here we are. I’ve written a piece about it at the New York Times, calling for early, precautionary action. More on that in a bit, but the first key point is that this is very different than where we were with Delta or even Alpha when they came on the scene. I wrote about both of them in a hurry, as soon as it became clear they were a threat—end of December 2020 for Alpha, end May 2021 for Delta. My New York Times article on Delta has the depressing headline that the pandemic’s deadliest phase could be ahead of us. I was pretty certain by the end of May that Delta, especially, was going to be terrible because it had already left a wide swath of death and suffering in India, and systematic data from the United Kingdom confirmed it wasn’t a fluke. My December 2020 article on Alpha for The Atlantic is titled “The Mutated Coronavirus Is a Ticking Bomb.” Here, it’s very, very different. Thanks to South African scientists, their public health infrastructure, their talent and dedication and the transparency of their government WE HAVE AN EARLY WARNING. A VERY EARLY WARNING. I cannot overemphasize how valuable this is, and what a gift they have given us. Thank you, thank you, thank you, South African scientists, medical workers, public health employees. But an early warning on what? Ah, that is the beauty of it. The earlier the warning, the less we know. I’ve done my best to keep up on all the information being shared by scientists on this (amazing! so much open science!) and my current conclusion is that everything is on the table, including that this just fizzles out or turns out to be a catastrophe. There are three open questions: transmissibility, immune evasion, disease course in infected people. Of the three, I think some level of immune evasion in terms of antibodies is the clearest prediction: this looks like it could cause more breakthrough infections in vaccinated or previously-infected people. But that is not, by itself, a catastrophe if the virus doesn’t make people very sick, or if it doesn’t transmit well. Both are still unknown, and all the possibilities are more or less on the table. For example, South Africa has had huge outbreaks, so for all we know, they’re detecting re-infections because of immune evasion, hence the rapid rise in cases: not the same as straightforward more transmissible. If the re-infections are then very mild to asymptomatic, it likely will not mean much. If they turn out to be severe as well, that’s a terrible outcome. Or, maybe it is more transmissible and the disease it causes is more severe and it has immune evasion on top. We don’t have enough data to rule this out. Having had some cases that show up be mild isn’t enough to draw any conclusions. Maybe it is mild as a re-infection and severe if no previous immunity from vaccination or previous infection. Maybe this is just an outbreak among a younger population. With so few detected cases, who can know? That is why my piece calls for an early, aggressive response until we know more, but we need to understand this is precautionary because we really don’t know. For all we know, this was first detected in South Africa, and is already widespread elsewhere. That’s why my New York Times piece today is titled: “We Got a Head Start on Omicron, So Let’s Not Blow It.” \"There’s very little we know for sure about Omicron, the Covid variant first detected in South Africa that has caused tremors of panic as winter approaches. That’s actually good news. Fast, honest work by South Africa has allowed the world to get on top of this variant even while clinical and epidemiological data is scarce. \"So let’s get our act together now. Omicron, which early indicators suggest it could be more transmissible even than Delta and more likely to cause breakthrough infections, may arrive in the United States soon if it’s not here already. \"A dynamic response requires tough containment measures to be modified quickly as evidence comes in, as well as rapid data collection to understand the scope of the threat.\" The piece calls for restrictions, testing, quarantine and a massive early effort to both understand what’s going on, and act like it could be terrible, but be ready to reverse quickly. If it is not a big threat, we can, and we should quickly reverse restrictions that are specific to it. If it is, it is much better to have acted early than to wait till clarity arrives but it’s too late to contain the threat. But precautionary action shouldn’t be unnecessarily sticky. Unfortunately, there are already a few signs that we will do theatrics and haphazard measures, rather than a comprehensive effort. Many countries have started issuing travel bans, but targeting passports rather than the virus. The one in the United States doesn’t even start till Monday (viruses don’t work on the weekends?) and isn’t paired with testing or quarantine at the border—just a blanket ban on a few nationalities. That’s pandemic theatrics, and we have had too much of that already for two years. \"The United States, the European Union and many nations have already announced a travel ban on several African countries. Such restrictions can buy time, even if the variant has started to spread, but only if they are implemented in a smart way along with other measures, not as pandemic theatrics.\" As I conclude the piece: \"All this requires leadership and a global outlook. Unlike in the terrible days of early last year, we have an early warning, vaccines, effective drugs, greater understanding of the disease and many painful lessons. It’s time to demonstrate that we learned them.\" An early alert like this is the difference between calling firefighters at the first sign of an ember versus waiting to see if the house goes up in flames. To have the gift of this early warning about Omicron without taking fast aggressive action would be as if those firefighters waited for billows of smoke before responding. South Africa has given the world a precious gift, and along with our gratitude and support and resources so that they can better battle their own outbreak, this gift deserves to be treated with the respect it deserves, by acting on it."),

This article is intended to serve as a primer, rather than one of our more usual technical analyses: cryptocurrencies continue to play a key role in many areas of cyber-crime being used for everything from online marketplace transactions to ransomware demands. However, with a number of legitimate organisations ranging from the Bank of England to EY also taking an interest cryptocurrencies and the technologies behind them, it’s worth being informed.\n" +

                    "The 2000s saw an increase in the number and utility of entirely virtual currencies (as opposed to digital currencies backed by some form of legal tender).\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "A number of dry definitions of ‘virtual currency’ exist, with the European Central Bank defining it as:\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "“a type of unregulated, digital money, which is issued and usually controlled by its developers, and used and accepted among the members of a specific virtual community”[3]\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "By this broad definition, a number of things qualify as virtual currencies: while some online games such as World of Warcraft forbid the exchange of the in-game currency for any other form of money, a black market engaging in just this exists. Equally, a number of online marketplaces – especially within the gaming community – require the one-way exchange of legal tender for virtual currencies, e.g. Microsoft Points.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Of course, a common feature of all of the currencies discussed so far is that they’re centralised: the Federal Reserve is the centralised authority and repository for US dollars, GS&R – the company behind E-Gold – held a centralised ledger tracking transactions, and Microsoft naturally keep track of Microsoft Points.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "While not legal tender, the value of these currencies is agreed and accepted by all of the parties involved – much as people generally accept the declared value of paper money or an electronic bank transfer.\n" +

                    "Cryptocurrencies are so-called because of their use of cryptographic functions to secure transactions and limit the creation of new units of the currency. While not the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is once arguably the most famous example and was the first to be ‘decentralised’.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Instead of a centralised ledger (as would be the case with traditional currencies/government central banks), Bitcoin uses a public ledger known as the ‘blockchain’. Bitcoin transactions are broadcast to a network of privately operated nodes running Bitcoin software, a subset of which verify and process the transactions into groups called blocks (these machines are known as miners). All nodes keep a record of these blocks (hence ‘blockchain’) once they have been processed, thus keeping a distributed record of transactions and ownership.\n" +

                    "\n" +
                    "As miners are rewarded with Bitcoins in the form of both newly created Bitcoins and any transaction fees included within the block, the supply of Bitcoins is slowly increasing. To temper this flow, any new block requires a ‘proof-of-work’ to be accepted by the rest of the network. In brief, this is a task that takes a long time to complete but a short time to double-check.\n" +

                    "In the case of Bitcoin this proof-of-work is based on the SHA-256 hashing algorithm and is ultimately constrained by CPU speed, prompting the creation of specialised mining 'farms' such as the one pictured below (picture credit: Marco Krohn; CC-BY-SA-4.0).\n" +

            new BlogResponse(UUID.randomUUID().toString(),"jaswindervirk.jv.js@gmail.com","The USA and Its journey of Economic Superpower","In the words of Edward De Bono, “America is not a country, it’s an idea”. The modern era is marked by the presence of the United States as the world leader of the economy. With highest-ranking military strength and a solid economy, it is a melting point of an interconnected system that exists worldwide. Since the year 1871, the modern United States has continued to sustain its position as the world's most powerful and the largest economy. In 2019, in terms of Gross Domestic Product, the U.S economy stood at (approximately)  $21.44 Trillion, whereas in 2020 the size of its economy was expected to touch $22.32 Trillion. Well, that’s a huge number! The United States is the home to a total of three Trillion-Dollar companies making it a powerhouse of business. These are Amazon, Microsoft and Apple. Out of the top 10 richest people in the world, 8 of them belong to the United States. To name a few- Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Larry Page, etc. These statistics are proof of its charm in the world! As they say, ‘Rome was not built in one day’, similarly, the United States did not just wake up one day and claimed the position of an economic superpower. Dedicated efforts of a number of American citizens, the support of the government party and a belief in constant innovation has made it the most influential nation in the international community. But, there was a time when America was not a global power. The question arises, then how did it become an economic superpower? What are the factors that contributed to it? Well, for that we need to turn the pages of history! Let’s do that and decode its journey of becoming the number 1 economy in the world! 1850-1950: A Century That Changed it All for the United States Before the year 1800, America was not even on the list of top powerful nations. In fact, at that time India and Britain were economically very strong. Sadly, after Independence India could not reclaim its position in the coming years. America was trapped between the civil war and focussed on land-based expansions. During that time, Americans were divided into groups having different views. Where one group was supporting the land acquisition, the other group was against the imperialistic thought of more expansion. The latter group believed that it would lead to America getting involved in international politics and finally it would get lost in the havoc. Then, what happened after 1800 that the entire economic scene of the world took a dramatic turn! It was the Industrial Revolution. The advent of the industrial revolution acted like a volcanic eruption of opportunities for America’s economy to grow. As a matter of fact, it needed a more concentrated or centralized administrative system to efficiently handle the surging economy. Thus, the ultimate power got vested in the federal government. With the start of the 19th century, the United States turned its entire focus on ameliorating its infrastructure. During the 19th-century transport, the business was at boom and for a well-integrated transport business, the prime requirement was a good infrastructure. Making a smart move and understanding the ultimate demand several businessmen worked vigorously to improve its infrastructure. To facilitate the trade through water, a businessman named Cornelius Vanderbilt worked dedicatedly to make the shipping business effective. usa Once it was done, he moved his focus towards building the biggest railroad network in the U.S. A better shipment and road connectivity aided the transport of products helping its economy to grow further. The electric bulb was yet to be discovered during that time and in most houses, the source of light was oil lamps. This automatically pushed the demand for oil. Again the presence of interconnected shipment systems and infrastructure helped to expand the trade of oil. The first billionaire and an oil businessman John D. Rockefeller saw a great opportunity in the surging demand of oil. Well, he took complete advantage of this situation to expand his business. He not only started a company by the name Standard Oil but it went on to gain whopping shares of 90% in the US oil market. Although, later Standard Oil was broken up into smaller companies like Chevron, Exxon, Sohio, etc. john Then came a man who changed the face of the electricity forever by inventing the electric bulb. He was Thomas Elva Edison. After inventing the electric bulb he went on to start a firm by the name General Electric whose present market capitalization is nearly ₹4 Lakh crores. With the invention of the electric bulb and its commercialization, the United States witnessed a significant hike in demand for electrical appliances that further provided a backbone for economic expansion. andrew Businessmen in American were well aware that infrastructure would play a vital role in industrial development. And, they were working in this direction as well. For instance, Mr Andrew Carnegie did something that seemed impossible at the time. That Scottish man found out that when iron and carbon metal are heated at high temperature, a much stronger substance, steel is obtained. He used it to build one of its kind Mississippi Railroad Bridge. business Quit, a creation!! It was after this that steel gained popularity helping Andrew Carnegie to expand his business. He also helped to build the well-known skyscrapers in the United States. All such discoveries and inventions helped American to gain an edge in industrial output during the 1890s. It went ahead of Great Britain too. As the years passed the baton of innovations got handed over from some entrepreneurs to others. One of them was Henry Ford who changed the face of the 4-wheeler industry by initiating mass production of vehicles. What Happened after 1910? Between 1850-1950, the GDP of the United States witnessed a sharp pickup. During 1950, it had a 60% share in industrial output of the entire world. With the start of the 20th century, the economy of the United States had gained the position of the biggest economy in the world! After the 1950s the U.S turned its focus on other sectors such as service and technology. Although the industrial revolution of the United States went on throughout the time of World War II. It led to massive loss and destruction in European nations such as Great Britain, Germany, Italy, France. On the other hand, the United States reaped heavy benefits. Yes! Where European countries were busy in war and bloodshed, the United States was aiming for a jackpot. During the World War, it transported necessary weapons to a number of European nations to fight the war. You would be surprised to know that before World War II time, America was going through a Great Depression since 1929. This went on for a good 8-10 years. But, the advent of World War provided a merry situation for the U.S. The export of weapons to European nations during World War II pumped in a huge capital into the U.S economy. So much so that the U.S. was out of the Great Depression. World War II crippled the economic condition of most European nations but amid all these United States rose with flying colours! world war The United States followed its growth even after World War II. This is reflected by the GNP estimate of the U.S in 1940 was approximately $100 Billion that spiked to $5200 Billion in 1980. Woah! Its GNP grew by 5100% in 47 years. The Technology Revolution- After conquering the industrial sector of the world, the U.S. turned its focus to the ever-growing technology sector. Tech giants such as IBM, Apple, Microsoft, etc revolutionised the IT world of America taking the technological revolutions to new heights. Thanks to immigrants in the United States! The U.S has been a melting point of immigrants from all over the world! In fact, as per the statistics of 2017,  around 4.44 million people were immigrants. These immigrants bring not only their culture but their intellect and talent too. Their presence and innovative approach of entrepreneurs added to the overall productivity of the nation. The U.S. has faced recession a couple of times but its business-friendly environment and presence of capital in abundance have always kept it going. Philanthropy Enables Growth- People like John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, etc who acted as the pillars of the development of the United States also made significant contributions towards philanthropic works. For instance, John D. Rockefeller alone donated around $530 million during that time. The amount was donated towards education, innovation and research programs. It was more like a competition for philanthropy among significant figures of the U.S. The money contributed by businessmen towards sectors like education, research, etc again supported the growth of the United States. Sadly, India lacks in this regard. There is less to no philanthropy done towards the research and innovation in our country! America was able to transform its global presence after the 1800s due to continuous innovation,! This innovation has always been supported by technology, high-class infrastructure and availability of natural resources. Ultimately, it ushered other nations to become an economic superpower!")
